I was asked to publish this, so here it is.  
Ever made an IRC bot and wanted a quick and dirty test-server? Well then this is for you.


This is an ad-hoc IRC server for testing purposes.  
The server will start up a defined number of IRC servers 
and then a defined number of fictive clients which will join and start messing around.
